>I just bought this exact machine pulled out of the box plugged in tried running various sizes through it appears to be cutting every couple inches of the wire but not cutting a clean cut and before you ask no thus isn't my first wire stripper and yes I adjusted the height and it's just not cutting clean at all.
>Any advice would be great.
